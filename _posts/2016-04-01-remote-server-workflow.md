excerpt: A note on how I set up and use a testing server.
---

A few years ago, I discovered [digitalocean](http://www.digitalocean.com), and I was subsequently given a lot of promotional
credit. It worked, because I'm hooked now (like a digital fish, in a digital ocean?).

Here's the deal: for $5/month you can spin up a very simple small server with root access, and a public facing IP. They
 advertise that it only takes 55 seconds, which is largely true. Do you just want a clean machine to test something on?
 Spin it up, get a drink, and when you come back you have root access.

Even better, you can create a snapshot of a machine just how you like it, and spin it up as necessary, paying just
$0.02 per GB of snapshot storage per month. This gives great flexibility, at almost no cost.

_Yes, but what about AWS?_ I honestly haven't gone to the trouble of comparing services carefully. I know that digitalocean
has transparent and reasonable pricing, and is simple to use, neither of which are true for AWS or Azure.
