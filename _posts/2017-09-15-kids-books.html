I read a fair number of kids books in my line of work. Some are excellent, while others should never have been published. Here's a short record (updated sporadically).

  <h2>The Good</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Horton Hatches an Egg, by Dr. Seuss. "An elephant's faithful 100 percent", ending is biologically implausible.</li>
    <li>Church mice books, by Graham Oakley. Classic British humor.</li>
    <li>Salty Dog books, by Gloria and Ted Rand. Great art, and fun sailing stories.</li>
    <li>Katy and the Big Snow, by Virginia Lee Burton.</li>
    <li>Something Big has Been Here, by Jack Prelutsky. Fun poems with the largest vocabulary of any kids book I've ever seen.</li>
    <li>Most books by Dr. Seuss</li>
    <li>The 12 original Magic School Bus books (not the movie tie-in books, or the Scholastic reader books)</li>
    <li>Most Dorling-Kindersley Eyewitness books (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Train-Eyewitness-Books-John-Coiley/dp/0756650321">example</a>)</li>
    <li>Christina Katerina and the Box, Patricia Lee Gauch</li>
  </ul>
      

  <h2>The Bad</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Clifford books</li>
    <li>Amelia Bedelia books</li>
    <li>Pretty much any Disney or movie/show/product tie-in book</li>
  </ul>
