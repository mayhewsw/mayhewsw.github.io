I read a fair number of kids books in my line of work. Some are excellent, while others should never have been published. Here's a short record (updated sporadically).

  <h2>The Good</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Horton Hatches an Egg, by Dr. Seuss. "An elephant's faithful 100 percent", ending is biologically implausible.</li>
    <li>Church mice books, by Graham Oakley. Classic British humor.</li>
    <li>Salty Dog books, by Gloria and Ted Rand. Great art, and fun sailing stories.</li>
    <li>Katy and the Big Snow, by Virginia Lee Burton.</li>
    <li>Something Big has Been Here, by Jack Prelutsky. Fun poems with the largest vocabulary of any kids book I've ever seen.</li>
  </ul>
      
  

  <h2>The Bad</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Clifford books</li>
    <li>Amelia Bedelia books</li>
  </ul>
