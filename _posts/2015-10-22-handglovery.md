#### Introduction

This is a test post, and uses several different features of Jekyll so I can become familiar with it! (This reminded me of [handglovery](http://classic.fontshop.com/education/pdf/typeface_anatomy.pdf)).

I have been very impressed with the integration of Jekyll and Github pages. This theme is [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/), from @mdo.

#### Let's try some code

Here is some code, in python.

~~~python
def fib(n):
  if n < 2:
    return 1
  return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
~~~

This can be sped up significantly if it is memoized. I leave it as an exercise to the reader to implement this and show fast of a speedup it is.

#### Let's try some math

Here is some math (this is [Euler's identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity), and is perhaps the most beautiful thing in all of mathematics):

$$
e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0
$$

(Edit: you might say that this is just composing definitions and there is nothing interesting happening here. Still... you're probably right.)

#### How about an image?

This is a screenshot from the [English Language and Usage Stack Exchange](http://english.stackexchange.com/), in which Joe Blow offers an unbiased, non-hyperbolic, and well-informed opinion.
